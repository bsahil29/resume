        \item {The project aimed at looking for different ways of assisting users of search systems in \textbf{constructing queries that are richer} and \textbf{more likely to retrieve the desired results}}
\item{The research problem that was the focus of the internship was to \textbf{use historical data} (previous queries provided by users, the results that were returned, meta data about them, as well as interactions of the users with these results) to build machine learnt models that \textbf{generate reformulation suggestions}}
\item{The solution built on published baseline models and research in these areas, requiring familiarity with current state-of-the-art literature in related areas like \textbf{NLP}}
\item{Most of the experimentation was done via toolkits available in \textbf{Python, TensorFlow and PyTorch}}
